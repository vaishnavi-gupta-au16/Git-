5 we will learn what are branches

git hub - cloud provider
for uploading - git push

git clone url <https>-> will clone the repository to your local

git log - 
what is git log 

1. git clone url -> it will for the first time clone the repository from cloud to your local

2. the command to push your chnages to local to cloud

git push origin <branch_name>
you are by default initially in master brANCH
git branch // will tell you the name of your current branch
1. we did git clone
2. make all of your commits in the repositiry
3 now if you want to push these change back to the cloud you will use
git branch
git push origin <branch_name>


git branch <branch_name>
this command will create a branch with name branch_name
git checkout <branch_name> -> to switch the branch and it will send you to the top of the particular branch
git merge <branch_name> this will merge branch <branch_name> into master.
to merge a branch 

go to destination branch in which you want to merge

git checkout master
git merge <branch_name_you_want_to_merge>


git branch -D branch_name -> to delete the branch
git push origin dev,masster,anything
